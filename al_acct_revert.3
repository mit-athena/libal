.SH NAME
al_acct_revert, al_acct_cleanup \- Revert a user's account setup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <al.h>
.PP
.B int al_acct_revert(const char *\fIusername\fP, pid_t \fIsessionpid\fP)
.B int al_acct_cleanup(const char *\fIusername\fP)

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions remove entries from a user's list of active login
sessions as recorded in the sessions database (see sessions(5)) and
revert the changes made by account setup if the user no longer has any
active login sessions.
.PP
The
.I al_acct_revert
function removes
.I sessionpid
from the list of active login sessions.  (If
.I sessionpid
is not in the list, then no action is taken.)  The
.I al_acct_cleanup
function tests for the existence of each process in the list of active
login sessions and removes those which no longer exist.  If either
function empties the process list, it undoes any changes made to the
local passwd and group databases during account creation, removes the
user's temporary home directory if one was created, and detaches the
user's home directory if it was attached.
.SH RETURN VALUES
Either function may return the following values:
.TP 15
.I AL_SUCCESS
The function successfully completed.
.TP 15
.I AL_EPERM
The function did not have expected access to local system databases.
.TP 15
.I AL_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
